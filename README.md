### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
 After performing a Linear Regression Analysis of the data columns in the MechaCar_mpg.csv, the following questions is to be answered:
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  Is our p-value<alpha?
- Looking at the results of the linear regression model, the last column shows the p-values for the different variables. 
  We can see that the <b> vehicle length </b> & the <b> Vehicle ground clearance </b> both have p-values much less than the significant level of 0.05%,
  meaning that we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we can state the the two variables have a significant impact on
  MPG(miles per gallon)





* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
